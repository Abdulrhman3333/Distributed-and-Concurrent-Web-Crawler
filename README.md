# Distributed-and-Concurrent-Web-Crawler
In this application, one  device acts as a master component that divides a large task/computation into multiple smaller  tasks and then distributes these smaller tasks to slave components. Each slave component  receives the task(s) from the master for processing and then sends the results back to the master.
